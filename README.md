# HEY YOU!
If you see this message, welcome to the commit history! 
I'm putting a line of javascript in here that I'll be using when I write this document, to make it easier to populate the table of contents

```javascript
let content = "Cloning your repository";
var replaceMap = {
   [" "]:"-",
   ["'"]:"",
   ["?"]:""
};
console.log(content.toLowerCase().replace(/ |'|\?/gi, function(elm){
  return replaceMap[elm];
}));
```
As seen on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15604140/replace-multiple-strings-with-multiple-other-strings)
